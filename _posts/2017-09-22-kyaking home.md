The excitement had been building for weeks leading up to this camping trip, and rightly so. This was the first time we would go out camping together as a group. The reason behind our trip... Sian, a single mother to a teenage son who felt like she was losing her boy to the call of screens and computer games with tears in her eyes asked me a question that really made me think. "How do you maintain such a good bond with Kane?". Kane is my son who is also mid teens. I always knew Kane and I had a great relationship but I never really stopped to think about it before because the activities that make up such a big part of our lives were always just second nature to us, not just for Kane but our daughter also. Being outdoors is something we have always done, riding pushbikes and motorbikes together as a family, kayaking, camping and 4w driving. All these activities help us to form bonds and build a sense of responsibility in our kids that i had not necessarily recognised as being a conscious choice previously. After a period of reflection I said "hey, why don't we all go camping!" Casey, another close friend and also partner in this Mums Out Camping venture jumped on the band wagon with her three kids also. While Casey does have a husband too he is not always present and that left her with a sense of feeling like she and the kids were missing out on these types of experiences.


So it was 4pm Friday afternoon, 2 hours later than our expected departure time after loading and re-loading 3 vehicles multple times but anywho we were finally on our way, 4 adults , 4 teenage boys two little girls and a baby! The first stop with any good camping trip is to always make sure you have enough fuel so off to the petrol station we went. Low and behold I ran out of fuel unexpectedly 15meters before I got to the bowser, not to worry though I handed over the drivers seat and got out to push it the rest of the way. Next, Joe pulls up to the bowser and realises the key to the fuel cap has been bent and he cannot get the fuel cap open, but he has to because the car is on 1/4 tank and just wont make the distance sooo after trying for 10mins to bend it back into shape he was finally able to get the key to a point it would open the cap! Ok no big deal we are ready to be on the road again and then.... the fuel doesn't want to pull through in my vehicle that had run out and yet again we were at a stand still.
