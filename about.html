    <h4> Kerralie Nardelli </h4>
    <p> My name is Kerralie and I am 35 years old. I am a mother to two amazing kids, one very sassy seven year old girl and a 16 year old adrenaline junkie! I am a wife to my partner of 19 years, married for 7. In amongst this I also work full-time as a Systems Administrator and Educator for Department of Health. All of these things, which are a big part of who I am can make it easy to forget that this is NOT ALL that I am. Inside of me there is still a strong independant woman who wants to be able to celebrate and never loose that part of me.
    The idea of camp sanity was to enable women to give themselves permission to take care of themselves, their well-being and importantly their mental health. It is an opportunity for every woman regardless of being a mother or not, to step outside the noise of everyday life and remember who they are. Camp Sanity is a way to bring women together and help empower them through nature and the experience of camping which some may feel they need a man by their side to do, and this is simply not ture. It can be extremely rewarding to know in the right environment you are capable of more than you ever thought possible! </p>
